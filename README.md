# artificial_intelligence

#### Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a multidisciplinary field of computer science that aims to create systems or machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, perception, and even speech recognition. The overarching goal of AI is to develop intelligent agents that can adapt, improve, and perform autonomously in diverse environments.

## Project Overview

### Data Loading:

#### Imports the pandas library and reads a CSV file ('cancer.csv') into a DataFrame.

### Data Preprocessing:

#### Separates the features (denoted as x) and the target variable (denoted as y) from the dataset.

### Train-Test Split:

#### Splits the data into training and testing sets using the scikit-learn library. 80% of the data is used for training, and 20% is reserved for testing.

### Neural Network Model Construction:

#### Builds a sequential neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model consists of an input layer with 256 neurons, a hidden layer with 256 neurons, and an output layer with 1 neuron. Sigmoid activation functions are used.

### Model Compilation:

#### Compiles the neural network model with the Adam optimizer, binary crossentropy loss function (common for binary classification), and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

### Model Training:

#### Trains the model on the training data for 1000 epochs.

### Model Evaluation:

#### Evaluates the trained model on the testing data using the evaluate method, printing the results. This typically includes metrics like loss and accuracy.

### The overall goal is to build  a neural network model for cancer diagnosis, and evaluate its performance on unseen test data.


## Key Concepts in AI:

### Machine Learning (ML):

#### ML is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

### Neural Networks:

#### Inspired by the human brain, neural networks are a fundamental component of many AI systems. They consist of interconnected nodes (artificial neurons) that process information and learn patterns.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP):

#### NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Applications include language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.

### Computer Vision:

#### This field involves teaching machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data. Applications range from facial recognition to object detection.

### Robotics:

#### AI plays a crucial role in robotics, allowing robots to perceive their environment, make decisions, and perform tasks autonomously.

### Expert Systems:

#### These are AI systems designed to mimic the decision-making ability of a human expert in a particular domain. They use a knowledge base and inference engine to solve specific problems.

### Reinforcement Learning:

#### An area of ML where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, allowing it to improve its decision-making over time.
